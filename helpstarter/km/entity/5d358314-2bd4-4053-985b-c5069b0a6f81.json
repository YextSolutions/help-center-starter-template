    "answer": "There has been huge progress in developing treatments for patients with COVID\\-19. Treatments for COVID\\-19 should be decided on an individual basis between the person and the healthcare professional looking after them. The choice will depend on the severity of disease and the risk of disease worsening (including the person\u0027s age and whether they have any health problems). WHO maintains a list of recommended treatments, together with the evidence for each, available at [https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/nBkO1E](https://app.magicapp.org/#/guideline/nBkO1E).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese currently include:\n\n\n\n\n\n* for non\\-severe COVID\\-19: nirmatrelvir\\-ritonavir; molnupiravir; remdesivir\n* for severe COVID\\-19: corticosteroids (including dexamethasone); IL\\-6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab or sarilumab); baricitinib; remdesivir.\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from these medications, amongst the most commonly and globally used, and important treatments is oxygen for severely ill patients. WHO leads work which aims to improve global capacity and access to oxygen production, distribution and supply to patients.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor corticosteroids, further specific information can be found in the Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone [questions and answers](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel\\-coronavirus\\-2019/question\\-and\\-answers\\-hub/q\\-a\\-detail/coronavirus\\-disease\\-covid\\-19\\-dexamethasone).",
